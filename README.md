# Even Number Extractor: A List Comprehension Exercise

This repository features a Python script that demonstrates how to filter and extract even numbers from a user-provided list of integers using list comprehension. This script is ideal for beginners who want to learn about list comprehensions, input handling, and basic conditional logic in Python.

## Description

The script takes a comma-separated string of numbers as input, converts it into a list of integers, and then uses list comprehension to filter out the even numbers. The resulting list of even numbers is then printed to the console.

### How It Works

1. **User Input:** 
    - The user is prompted to input a list of numbers separated by commas (e.g., `1,2,3,4,5,6`).

2. **Splitting and Conversion:**
    - The input string is split into individual components based on commas.
    - Each component is then converted from a string to an integer.

3. **Filtering Even Numbers:**
    - A list comprehension is used to iterate through the list of integers, filtering out only the even numbers.

4. **Output:**
    - The final list of even numbers is printed.

### Example

**Input:**
```bash
1,2,3,4,5,6
